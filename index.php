        <h2>"Climate change is affecting us all. Think about how it has affected you
            and what you can do to make the world a better place. I believe that
            working to improve always begins with yourself. The collective whole of
            each individual can really make a difference"</h2>

        <p>I have lived in Vermont for the past 14 years and over that time I have seen
            the temperatures during bother summer and winter raise a considerable amount.
            In the early 2000's, we had multiple northeaster's every winter amounting in 12"+ inches each time. In the past
            few years, storms that were once common have become rare. Less snow means
            that the skiing season is severely impacted. While the changes aren't extreme, the changes are irrefutable and undeniable.
            In order to help prevent these changes, we must all make decisions and
            lifestyle changes to ensure that we are all doing our part in helping keep our beautiful planet clean and
            relatively pollution free. Some things I try to do to reduce my carbon
            footprint include:
        </p>
        <ul id="list">
            <li>Recycling</li>
            <li>Walking or biking places</li>
            <li>Using a refillable water bottle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While I may not be able to make a huge difference in my carbon footprint, I
            know that as a society we must continue to make huge changes around carbon
            footprints and pollution. If we don't continue to make these eco-friendly
            changes and decisions, we will continue to harm the ecosystems around us the
            planet as a whole.
