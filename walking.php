            <p>Walking is a healthy, eco-friendly alternative to taking the bus or driving a
                car. Everyday when I go to class I either take the bus or walk because it helps
                reduce my carbon footprint. Every time I go somewhere I check to see if I can
                get there by walking because I would rather walk somewhere than drive. With the
                available buses and walking paths on campus, making healthier choices for the
                environment and myself is a no brainer. UVM students are more conscious of
                their carbon footprints and there are many initiatives and clubs on campus
                promoting healthier lifestyles that also help the planet.</p>
