            <p>Since coming to The University of Vermont I have been sure to think about 
                everything I throw away. Everyday, when I go to throw something in the trash 
                I ask myself “can this be recycled?” Living on campus has made this change 
                easier for me because of the ease of recycling here. Every room comes with a 
                recycling bin and that alone makes it’s much easier to be eco-friendly.All 
                of the recycling bins also have labels that make recycling simple. While one 
                person recycling may not seem like much, when everyone pitches in and does 
                their part it makes a huge difference. </p>
